# Machine Learning

## Introduction

Machine learning (ML) is a field of study concerned to build mathematical models from data.
Those models have tunable parameters that can be adapted to observed data, this way, we say that the model "learns" from the data.
After those models been adjusted to the observed data, they can be used to predict aspects of new data.

The ML algorithms can be categorized into three main groups: *supervised* learning, *unsupervised* learning, and *reinforcement* learning.

## Implemented algorithms

### Supervised learning
Supervised learning involves modeling the relationship between measured features of data and some label associated with the data.
In other words, the algorithm receives pairs of inputs and desired outputs and finds a way to produce the desired output given an input.
Implemented methods:

- Linear regression


## Tests

The unit tests were developed using the PyTest library.
