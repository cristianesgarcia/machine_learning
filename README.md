# Machine Learning

## Introduction

Machine learning (ML) is a field of study concerned to build mathematical models from data.
Those models have tunable parameters that can be adapted to observed data, this way, we say that the model "learns" from the data.
After those models been adjusted to the observed data, they can be used to predict aspects of new data.

The ML algorithms can be categorized into three main groups: *supervised* learning, *unsupervised* learning, and *reinforcement* learning.
